How to run application:

This app runs using Apache Tomcat server version 8.0.

Method 1: Use a development environment which supports Java EE tools (eclipse, for example). Download
	  version 8.0 of Tomcat to your localhost. Import the attached WAR file as a 'dynamic web project'
	  and select the Tomcat 8.0 as your server. Right click on the project and select 'Run on server'.
	  If the browser does not open automatically, the file path should be 
	  "http://localhost:8080/SSCoursework_Prototype/"

Method 2: Upload the attached WAR file to a server environment which uses Tomcat and run it from there.
